app.py             : Responsible for defining the structure of the HTML layout using Dash components.
		     It serves as the entry point for the application, outlining the core user interface elements.

callback.py        : Contains all the callback functions for interactive elements.
		     This file manages dynamic updates, linking user inputs to outputs in the UI, and processes events triggered by the app.

chromadex.py       : Handles interactions with the database and manages data encodings. 
		     It ensures proper integration between the video data and the appâ€™s functionality.

turntranscripts.py : Contains the logic to convert video files (located in the assets/videos folder) into text transcripts. 
		     These transcripts are then saved as .srt files in the srts folder for further use in the app.


corpus.txt         : A plain text file that lists the names of all the video files in the database. 
		     This is used to keep track of which videos are available for processing and display.

requirements.txt   : Specifies the Python package dependencies required for the project. 
		     Running pip install -r requirements.txt ensures all necessary packages are installed.


.env               : Stores key-value pairs for environment-specific configurations, such as API keys, database URLs, or any other sensitive information. 
		     These values are loaded into the application environment for secure and flexible configuration.


assets/styles.css  : Contains the CSS styles that define the visual appearance of the application. 
		     This includes layout, typography, color schemes, and other styling rules to enhance the UI's design and user experience.
